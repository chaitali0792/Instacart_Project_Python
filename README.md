Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they wanted to uncover more information about their sales patterns.
The Instacart stakeholders were most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They wanted to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.

To handle this scenario, I performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. My analysis using Python would helped them to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
